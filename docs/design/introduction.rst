The `OPNFV Copper <https://wiki.opnfv.org/copper>`_ project aims to help ensure that virtualized infrastructure deployments comply with goals of the VNF designer/user, e.g. re affinity and partitioning (e.g. per regulation, control/user plane separation, cost…). This is a "requirements" project with initial goal to assess "off the shelf" basic OPNFV platform support for policy management, using existing open source projects such as OpenStack Congress and OpenDaylight Group-Based Policy (GBP). The project will assess what policy-related features are currently supported through research into the related projects in OpenStack and ODL, and testing of integrated vanilla distributions of those and other dependent open source projects in the OPNFV’s NFVI platform scope.
