# What this is: script 1 of 2 for installation of a test server for Congress.
# Status: this is a work in progress, under test.
#
# Prequisite: OPFNV install per https://wiki.opnfv.org/copper/academy/joid
# On jumphost:
# - Congress installed through install_congress_1/2/3/4.sh
# - ~/env.sh created as part of Congress install (install_congress_3.sh)
# How to use:
#   Install OPNFV per https://wiki.opnfv.org/copper/academy/joid
#   $ source ~/git/copper/tests/setup/install_congress_testserver_1.sh

# Following are notes on creating a container as test driver for Congress. 
# This is based upon an Ubuntu host as installed by JOID.

# === Create and Activate the Container ===

# <code>
# On the jumphost
sudo apt-get install lxc
sudo lxc-create -n trusty-copper -t /usr/share/lxc/templates/lxc-ubuntu -- -b ubuntu ~/opnfv
sudo lxc-start -n trusty-copper -d
sudo lxc-info --name trusty-copper
export COPPER_HOST=""
while [ "$COPPER_HOST" == "" ]; do 
  export COPPER_HOST=$(sudo lxc-info --name trusty-copper | grep IP | awk "/ / { print \$2 }")
done
echo COPPER_HOST = $COPPER_HOST
echo export COPPER_HOST=$COPPER_HOST >>~/env.sh
scp ~/admin-openrc.sh ubuntu@$COPPER_HOST:/home/ubuntu
scp ~/env.sh ubuntu@$COPPER_HOST:/home/ubuntu
scp ~/git/copper/tests/setup/install_congress_testserver_2.sh ubuntu@$COPPER_HOST:/home/ubuntu
ssh ubuntu@$COPPER_HOST "~/install_congress_testserver_2.sh; exit"
# </code>
